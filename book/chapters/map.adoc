= Map

A map is a data structure to store pairs of data: *key* and *value*. In an array, you can only store values. The arrayâ€™s key is always the position index. However, in a *Map* the key can be whatever you want.

IMPORTANT: Map is a data structure that _maps_ *keys* to *values*.

Many languages have maps already built-in. This is an example in JavaScript/Node:
