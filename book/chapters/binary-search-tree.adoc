= Binary Search Tree

.The Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree that keeps the following constaints:
* Each node must have at most 2 children. Usually referred as left and right.
* All trees must a have a root node.
* Nodes values must be ordered after each insert/delete operation.
* The order of nodes values must be: left child < parent < right child.

== Implementing a Binary Search Tree

The first step is to implement the TreeNode:

.Binary Tree Node's constructor
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/trees/binary-tree-node.js[tag=snippet, indent=0]
----

Does this look familiar to you? It’s almost like the linked list node, but instead of having next and previous, it has left and right. That guarantees that we have at most two children.

We also added the meta object to hold some metadata about the node, like duplicity, color (for red-black trees), or any other data needed for future algorithms.

We implemented the node, now let’s go with the tree:

.Binary Search Tree's class
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js[tag=snippet, indent=0]

  add(value) { /* ... */ }
  find(value) { /* ... */ }
  remove(value) { /* ... */ }
  getMax() { /* ... */ }
  getMin() { /* ... */ }
}
----

This guarantees that our trees have one root element from where we can navigate left or right based on the value that we are looking for. We have placeholders for the operations that we are going to implement in a moment.

=== Inserting new elements in a BST

.For inserting an element in a BST we have two scenarios:
1.  If tree is empty (root element is null), we add the newly created node as a root and we are done!
2.  Starting from the root, compare the node’s value against the new element. If node has higher than new element, we move to the right child, otherwise to the left. We check recursively each node until we find an empty spot where we can put the new element and keep the rule right < parent < left.
3.  If we insert the same value multiple times, we don’t want duplicates. So, we can keep track using a duplicity counter.

For instance, let’s say that we want to insert the values 19,21,10,2,8 in a BST:

.Inserting values on a BST.

In the last box, when we are inserting node 18, we start by the root (19). Since 18 is less than 19, then we move left. Node 18 is greater than 10, so we move right. There’s an empty spot and we place it there. Let’s code it up:

.Binary Search Tree's class
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js[tag=add, indent=0]
----
<1> We are using a helper function `findNodeAndParent` to iterate through the tree finding a node with current value “found” and its parent.
<2> We are taking care of duplicates. Instead of inserting duplicates we are keeping a multiplicity tally. We have to decrease it when removing nodes.

=== Finding a value in a BST

We can implement the find method using the helper `findNodeAndParent` as follows:

.Binary Search Tree's find methods
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js[tag=find, indent=0]
----

`findNodeAndParent` is a recursive function that goes to the left child or right depending on the value. However, if the value already exists, it will return it in `found` variable.

=== Removing elements from a BST

Deleting a node from a BST have three cases.

.The node is a
1. leaf
2. parent with one child
3. parent with two children/root.

==== Removing a leaf (Node with 0 children)

Deleting a leaf is the easiest, we just look for their parent and set the child to null.

.Removing node without children from a BST.

Node 18, will be hanging around until the garbage collector is run. However, there’s no node referencing to it so it won’t be reachable from the tree anymore.

==== Removing a parent (Node with 1 children)

Removing a parent is not as easy, since you need to find new parents for its children.

.Removing node with 1 children from a BST.
image:image38.png[image,width=528,height=192]


In the example, we removed node 10 from the tree so its child (node 2) needs a new parent. We made node 19 the new parent for node 2.

==== Removing a full parent (Node with 2 children) or root

This is the trickiest of all cases because we need to find new parents for two children.

.Removing node with two children from a BST.
image:image39.png[image,width=528,height=404]


In the example, we delete the root node 19. This leaves the two orphans (node 10 and node 21). There’s no more parents because node 19 was the *root* element. One way to solve this problem, is to *combine* the left subtree (Node 10 and descendants) into the right subtree (node 21). The final result is node 21 is the new root.

What would happen if node 21 had a left child (e.g. node 20)? Well, we would move node 10 and its descendants bellow node 20.

==== Implementing removing elements from a BST

All the described scenarios removing nodes with 0, 1 and 2 children can be sum up on this code:

.Binary Search Tree's remove method
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js[tag=remove, indent=0]
----
<1> Try to find if value exists on the tree.
<2> If value doesn’t exist we are done!
<3> Create new subtree without the value to delete
<4> Check the multiplicity (duplicates) and decrement the count in case we have multiple nodes with the same value
<5> If the `nodeToRemove` was the root, then we move the removed node’s children as the new root.
<6> If it was not the root, then we go to the deleted node’s parent and put their children there.


We compute `removedNodeChildren`, which is the resulting subtree after combining the children of the deleted node.

The method to combine subtrees is the following:

.Binary Search Tree's combine method
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js[tag=combine, indent=0]
----

Take a look at code above and the example. You will see how to remove node 30 and combine both children subtree and keeping the BST rules. Also, this method uses a helper to get the left-most node. We can implement it like this:

.Binary Search Tree's get left most method
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js[tag=leftMost, indent=0]
----

That’s all we need to remove elements from a BST. Check out the complete BST implementation at: https://github.com/amejiarosario/algorithms.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js

== Differentiating a balanced and non-balanced Tree

As we insert and remove nodes from a BST we could ended up like the tree on the left:

.Balanced vs Unbalanced Tree.
image:image40.png[image,width=454,height=201]

The tree on the left is unbalanced. It actually looks like a Linked List and has the same runtime! Searching for an element would be *O(n)*. However, on a balanced tree the search time is *O(log n)*. That’s why we always want to keep the tree balanced. In further chapters, we are going to explore how to keep a tree balanced after each insert/delete.

== Tree Complexity

We can sum up the tree operations using Big O notation:

.Time complexity for a Binary Search Tree (BST)
|===
.2+.^s| Data Structure 2+^s| Searching By .2+^.^s| Insert .2+^.^s| Delete .2+^.^s| Space Complexity
^|_Index/Key_ ^|_Value_
| BST (**un**balanced) ^|- ^|O(n) ^|O(n) ^|O(n) ^|O(n)
| BST (balanced) ^|- ^|O(log n) ^|O(log n) ^|O(log n) ^|O(n)
|===
