= Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is one of the most common solutions when we want to extract some insights about a collection of data.
We can sort to get the maximum or minimun value and many algorithmic problems involves sorting data first.

.We are going to explore 3 basic sorting algorithms _O(n^2^)_ which have low overhead:
- <<Bubble Sort>>
- <<Selection Sort>>
- <<Insertion Sort>>

.Efficient sorting algorithms _O(n log n)_:
- <<Merge Sort>>
- <<Quicksort>>

Before we dive into the most well-known sorting algorithms, let's discuess about the sorting properties.
