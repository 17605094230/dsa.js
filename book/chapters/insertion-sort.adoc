= Insertion Sort

((Insertion sort)) is a simple sorting algorithm. It is one of the most natural way of sorting.  If you are given some cards that's probably how you are going to sort them.

// Good illustration on of sorting a deck of cards:  https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/insertion-sort/a/insertion-sort

== Insertion Sort Implementation

.Insertion sort
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/algorithms/sorting/insertion-sort.js[tag=sort, indent=0]
----
<1> Convert to array or clone the array.
<2> Start with the 2nd element. Everything on the left is considered sorted.
<3> Compare current element (2nd) to the previous one. If is bigger swap them, if not move to the next one.
<4> We check every element on the left side and swap any of them that are out of order


// .Swap function
// [source, javascript]
// ----
// include::{codedir}/algorithms/insertion-sort.js[tag=swap, indent=0]
// ----

// .This is how it works:
// . Visit 2nd. If the current element is smaller than the previous one move to the place it should be.
// . Visit next element and do the same thing. The left side is always sorted and the right is not (yet).
// . Repeat for the rest of the array.
